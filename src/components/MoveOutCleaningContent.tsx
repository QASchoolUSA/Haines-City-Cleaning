            <Accordion title="How long does a move-out clean take?">
                <p>
                    The duration depends on the size and condition of the home. A typical 3-bedroom home may take 4-8 hours for a deep move-out clean. We can provide a more accurate estimate when you contact us with details about your property.
                </p>
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion title="Is carpet cleaning included?">
                <p>
                    Standard vacuuming is included. If professional steam carpet cleaning is required (often a lease requirement), we can recommend trusted local partners or arrange it as a specialized add-on service.

            </Accordion>
            <Accordion title="Do you clean inside appliances?">
                <p>
                    Yes! Cleaning inside the fridge, oven, and microwave is a standard part of our move-in/move-out checklist, whereas it is usually an extra charge for recurring residential services.
